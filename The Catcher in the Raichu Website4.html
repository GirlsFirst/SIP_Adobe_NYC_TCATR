      <p class="thumbnail_align"> <img src="Sally.jpg" alt="" class="thumbnail"/> </p>
      <h4>Sally</h4>
      <p>Sally is the genius behind the idea of a Text Adventure project for our group's final project of the Girls Who Code program. When interviewed on this creation, she supplied that "I was thinking about the actual Text Adventure that we created before and I really like visual novels, but I've never experienced visual novels with Pokemon. This project was my chance to try something new and put something out there. I also haven't drawn in like 2 years so I get to stretch my creative talents with this assignment.".</p>

      <p class="thumbnail_align"> <img src="Nakia.jpg" alt="" class="thumbnail"/> </p>
      <h4>Nakia</h4>
      <p>Nakia is the brainchild of the pun in our creative name "The Catcher in the Raichu". She's a fan of the classic text "The Catcher in the Rye" by JD Salinger. She's also obsessed with all things Pokemon. Nakia is the type of person who visits a new place and instead of finding out more about what they do there, she's wondering whether they have a gym she can take over in her Pokemon Go app.</p>

    <div class="columns">
      <p class="thumbnail_align"> <img src="Lemiah.jpg" alt="" class="thumbnail"/> </p>
      <h4>Lemiah</h4>
      <p>Lemiah is the organizational mastermind behind the project as she's the one who pushes for clarity and sophistication in the complex plot of our novel by calling on those with more familiarity with Pokemon tournaments and visual novels. They in turn, elaborate on the comprehensiveness and specific details of the plot so that the story is seamless and compelling for the player.</p>

      <p class="thumbnail_align"> <img src="ProfilePic.jpg" alt="" class="thumbnail"/> </p>
      <h4>Wuraola</h4>
      <p>Wuraola's part to play in this project has been the development of the website that features the visual novel and the creation of a meticulous guide into the world of Pokemon for those readers with no knownledge of what Pokemon is or how to jump on to this latest trend. She also had a hand in the backend programming of the visual novel.</p>
